                            I have worked within a wide range of industries including automation,
                            aerospace and software development. I like exploring the world of entrepreneurship
                            and have been involved in UQ Ventures programs such as Startup Adventures,
                            Industry Challenges and the Curiosity Program.

                            marketing. In my free time I enjoy running, playing football, and catching up with friends.
